README for TexSmart
====================

TexSmart is a text understanding system built by Tencent AI Lab that supports 
lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis of text in Chinese and English. 
In addition to the functions supported by a typical core NLP tool (such as 
word segmentation, POS tagging, NER, syntactic parsing, and the like), TexSmart 
provides some unique features: fine-grained NER, semantic expansion, and rich 
semantic represention of (certain types of) entities.
